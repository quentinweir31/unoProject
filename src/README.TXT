Uno Game Project - Milestone #4
[Version 1.40]
December 8th 2023

-------------------------------Overview--------------------------------------
This milestone marks the fourth phase of our Uno card game project. Our goal is to integrate uno flip into out already existing GUI-based, 
playable version of Uno that allows players to engage through a graphical display using mouse input. We are including AI player capability 
which allows for a select number of AI players based on user's choice. We have now included a mechanism where players can save their progress 
in the game and load it when they choose to do so with java serialization and deserialization. The functionality to redo moves, undo moves and restart the game 
has been integrated as well.
