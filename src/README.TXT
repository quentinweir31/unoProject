Uno Game Project - Milestone #1
[Version 1.00]
October 22nd 2023

-------------------------------Overview--------------------------------------
This milestone marks the initial phase of our Uno card game project. Our goal is to develop a text-based, 
playable version of Uno that allows players to engage through the console using keyboard input.

-------------------------------Deliverables-----------------------------------
1. Game Features
View drawn cards.
Place cards using official notation.
Draw one card.
Execute actions associated with special cards.
Observe the resultant state of cards in text format.

------------------------------Documentation----------------------------------
UML modeling of the problem domain.
Class diagrams with complete variable and method signatures.
Sequence diagrams for important scenarios.
Detailed description of data structures and relevant operations for the Model part of the MVC.

-------------------------------Known Issues----------------------------------

Possible incomplete implementation, but remaining tasks will be documented.

-----------------------Changes Since Previous Deliverable--------------------

Initial implementation of core game features.
Created basic class diagrams and sequence diagrams for the Model part of MVC.
Began documentation on data structures and operations.


------------------------------Roadmap Ahead-----------------------------------

Complete the implementation of core game features.
Refine UML diagrams based on further development.
Continue documentation on data structures and operations.

Note: Uno Flip Support in Milestone 3
Uno Flip variation and rules will be addressed in Milestone 3.

-----------------------------Milestone 2 Preview-------------------------------
In Milestone 2, we will progress to develop a GUI-based iteration of the game, incorporating a View and Controller.
This version will feature a graphical display within a JFrame, and user interaction will be facilitated through mouse input.
Additionally, unit tests for the Model component will be created to cover areas within the game logic that are either missing or incomplete, 
with a focus on card placement, scoring, and penalty aspects.
