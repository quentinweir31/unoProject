Uno Game Project - Milestone #2
[Version 1.00]
November 13th 2023

-------------------------------Overview--------------------------------------
This milestone marks the second phase of our Uno card game project. Our goal is to develop a GUI-based, 
playable version of Uno that allows players to engage through a graphical display using mouse input.

-------------------------------Deliverables-----------------------------------
1. Game Features
View drawn cards.
Place cards using official notation.
Draw one card.
Execute actions associated with special cards.
Observe the resultant state of cards in text format.

------------------------------Documentation----------------------------------
UML modeling of the problem domain.
Class diagrams with complete variable and method signatures.
Sequence diagrams for important scenarios.
relevant operations for the Model part of the MVC.
Detailed description of data structures and changes made to the UML from milestone #1.

-------------------------------Known Issues----------------------------------

Possible incomplete implementation, but remaining tasks will be documented.

-----------------------Changes Since Previous Deliverable--------------------
Text-based implementatin has been converted to a GUI.
images of the playing cards have been added.
Updated documentation on data structures and operations.


------------------------------Roadmap Ahead-----------------------------------

Complete the implementation of core game features.
Refine UML diagrams based on further development.
Continue documentation on data structures and operations.

Note: Uno Flip Support in Milestone 3
Uno Flip variation and rules will be addressed in Milestone 3.

-----------------------------Milestone 3 Preview-------------------------------
In Milestone 3, We will incorporate Uno Flip cards into the game, implementing their
specific rules and scoring mechanisms. The game will also allow for a number of AI 
(Artificial intelligence) players. The behavior of these AI players will be designed 
for flexibility, allowing for different strategies.
